# What if Thanos Won World War 1? - The Snap

This mod brings balance to HoI4, by snapping half of all countries at the start of the game.

This works with any mod that uses the standard map - mods like Equestria at War will need additional work from you. For example, if you want to make the mod work with Equestria at War, you'd have to add the "REB"-tag to a province - similar to what I did to the Pitcairn Islands under history/states. This tag requires a single province so that they can annex states, sadly.

**Not Ironman compatible**.
